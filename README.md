This repository hosts all the smart contracts we worked on in practice.
The code is well commented and contains problem statements.

## 1. Lottery Smart Contract
A lottery is a form of gambling that involves the drawing of numbers at random for a prize.
People can chip in with a fixed amount that is linked to the possibility of their winning.
Winners are drawn at random. All the money received is distributed among winners after deducting a commission by the owner of lottery.

# 2. ERC 20 Smart Contract
The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) as another Token. For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens.
